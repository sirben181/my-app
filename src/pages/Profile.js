                        i started coding in the covid era june of 2021.Having worked in the constructio industry for <br />
                         some times after graduating from college having a bachelor degree in biochemistry. <br />
                         here is the best thing that has ever happened to my life. got into my passion <br />
                          something that i just wish i would have started early.
                          i was working in construction when i decided to do something that was in my <br />
                           mind for so long.
                           So i just started to do what i felt like i doing and wanted to do for so long. <br />
                            I quitted the job i was doing at the time and i had to starting to learn what the hell is coding.
                            i started running just like othjer guys do with html,css and js and then frameworks and a few databases.
