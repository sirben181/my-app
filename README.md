# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

 blog:
 features of a gfood blog:
 #White Space around the content
 #the blog should have some kind of navigation
 
 this will have blogs with author and comment section
 they will be categorized on the basis of title,content,and other things.
 ,projects:awesome projects that we have built explained and then linked to the blog if its one of the done project.
 body whereby: profile-with my details,photo and skills that i can offer.
 my earlier projects complete.

 even if its a single page website well and good.
 a blog will consist of posts that will be fetched from the database like mongo db or firestore
 these posts will have a place for comments and likes, post itself, author{ photo,name and what he does.}

 a footer with some links and social media icons( these should be in the profile somewhere or here in the footer.)
 this should be a fullstack application with a database such as mongo db or firestore database. and the hosting should be in netlify, github or any other free hosting.
  then i will buy a host, domain name and upload the site to make an online presence.
